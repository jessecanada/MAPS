# MAPS stands for Morphology And Phenotype Scoring
### MAPS is designed to automate the processing and interpretations of large amounts of microscopy images, but is adaptable to other types of images.
### It is written in python 3.x. After importing images, all preprocessing steps are written with openCV. Post-processing is written with Sci-kit Learn. Deep learning models are deployed on Azure Custom Vision.
### This project is a work in progress, and will be updated regularly.
